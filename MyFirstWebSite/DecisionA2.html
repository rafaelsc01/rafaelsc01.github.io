	<p>I achieved today's goals</p>



<p1>By the evening, I leaned back in my chair and glanced at my now-empty notebook. I felt this wave of relief—it was all done. I picked up my phone and texted my friend: 'Homework’s done. Beach tomorrow?' I may have missed out on the beach today, but I knew I’d earned a guilt-free day to enjoy tomorrow. And honestly, that made staying home totally worth it.</p1>
