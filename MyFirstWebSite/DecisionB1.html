<body> <p>I went to the beach with my friends</p>



<p1>I couldn’t resist the pull of the beach. I tossed my notebook aside, grabbed my phone, and texted my friend: 'On my way!' Within minutes, I was out the door, the warm sun on my face and the thought of homework completely pushed to the back of my mind.

The beach was everything I’d hoped for; waves crashing rhythmically, the sand warm beneath my feet, and laughter filling the air as my friend and I shared stories and played games. For a while, I let myself just relax and enjoy the moment. It felt so good to be free, to soak in the day without a care in the world.</p1>
